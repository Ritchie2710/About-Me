      <h2>About ME</h2>
      <p>
        My name is Richard or Ritchie I am 37 years old. I was born in Scotland
        but moved to norwich when I was less than a year old because of my my
        dad work. I have done alot in my life including travelljng across
        america over a month driving and flying some of it. Walked up mountains,
        volcanos and glaciers. I was a teacher for 15 years in scholls and
        colleges teaching sport.

      <h2>Health and life</h2>
      <p>
        I was diagnosed with diabeties when I was 5 just after my birthday. 4
        years ago I found out I had kidney failure with only 9% function overall
        in both kidneys. they disrupted my rugby work and life style. I was put
        on the transplant list and on dialaysis which meant i had to pump warm
        fluid in and out of my body for 5 months before I got the call that a
        transplant had come available, and on the 6th of Feburary 2019 I had a
        kidney and pancreas double transplant. Which means I no longer have
        diabeties and I dont have kidney failure. Recently diagnosed with ASD
        and ADHD which can sometimes affect me as a person
      </p>

      <h2>Educational background</h2>
      <p>
        After high school and getting my GCSEs I realised that A levels werent
        for me so i went to college and studied Sports science and then on to
        university studying sports science and education. After teaching for a
        few years I decided to go back to uni and do a degree in Computer
        science and business. Then returned to teaching in a college.
